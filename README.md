# Title: Python-Challenge - PyBank & PyPoll


**Overview:**

This is my assignment on using python to solve two excersises: PyBank and PyPoll. Within each exercise the below outputs needed to be created:

PyBank:
* Total Months
* Total Profits
* Average change in profits
* Greatest increase in profits; with Date and amount
* Greatest decrease in profits; with Date and amount



PyPoll:
* Name of the candidates
* Percent of votes and vote count
* Declaring the winner



Learnings:

I learned how to read and write into csv or text files, create and iterate lists through for loops, along with use math equations to print outputs.
I also learned how to print information in a different way using a varaible in PyBank, which is super slick and efficent with line breaks.
